Have you ever seen or imagined clothes that glow with colorful patterns? When I was little, my dad gave me a light-up teddy bear and it’s still my favorite stuffy to this day, which sparked my fascination with electronic textiles. I'm also a sewing nut— so much so that I dragged my machine all the way up from Nashville. The only problem is that I don’t know the first thing about coding to add tech like LEDs or sensors to my projects and without those skills, my ideas just kind of float around in my brain. This is why I’m super excited to take CS 103 so I can pick up some basics and turn my ideas into reality.
