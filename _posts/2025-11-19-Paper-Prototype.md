My final project is a lightup teddy bear that is designed to emulate my favorite childhood stuffed animal: a lightup Build-a-Bear my dad gave me (which unfortunately no longer turns on). It uses 5 independently controlled LEDs sewn into its limbs and chest. Each LED blinks and fades at a random brightness and random one-second interval (similar to the last arrays project). It automatically turns on when it is dark. When it isn't dark, you can press a momentary button and it will run for 15s before turning back off (if I can figure this out, if not it will have the lights blinking so long as the button is being presses if it light in the room).

One tip I would give my past self is to give myself more time to plan out the traces because I was really struggling to figure out how to connect everything without having any of the traces cross. I am also working on a 3d paper prototype which I will use aligator clips and tape to test as I am planning to put everthing on the inside of my teddy bear so that none of the components are visible from the outside.

## This is my Paper Prototype:
