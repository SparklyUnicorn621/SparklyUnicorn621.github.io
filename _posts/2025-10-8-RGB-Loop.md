This program simulates turning on different colored LEDs on using a loop where the 10th itteration of the loop prints the color and the color changes every three prints.

One tip I would give to my past self would be to not get stuck trying to make all the lights switch at once but focus on the logic first. This way, I would have started with the if/else if/else statements to print every 10th itteration and then move on to trying to figure out how to switch the colors from there. Once I realized I needed one variable to track the total loop itterations and another to track how many times each color had been printed, everything finally made sense.

## This is the output:
