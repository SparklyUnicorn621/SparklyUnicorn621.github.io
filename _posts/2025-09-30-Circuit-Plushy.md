In this project, the goal was to create a plushy with three lights that work only when the switch is both on and the button is pressed. In my project, the aligator clip prototype I made worked but the plushy lights are always on when the battery is in.

Some tips I would give to my past self are to use shorter conductive thread because it snaps super easily and to not put everything on the same side.

## Here are my photos!
