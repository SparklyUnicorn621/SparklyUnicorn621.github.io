Hey yall! My name is Laela, and I’m a sophomore and a prospective economics major. I've only been sewing for a few years. I'm a fully self-taught hobbyist with no formal education, but it's currently one of my favorite hobbies (alongside embroidery and painting) and I even dragged my sewing machine all the way from Nashville. I really love creating new pieces of clothing or accessories to wear (especially when I make them out of old clothes I don’t wear anymore or thrift) and you will often catch me wearing my projects around. On the programming side, I have zero experience and have never really dabbled or tried coding before. In this class, I hope to learn some foundational basics of coding so I can start incorporating tech with my sewing projects, like creating light-up wearable art. One boring fact about me: I am really good at grilling/barbecuing and can make a mean steak or ribs (this summer I finally surpassed my dad and have achieved the title of grillmaster in my house).
