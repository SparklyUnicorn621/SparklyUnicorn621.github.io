This program plays Twinkle Twinkle Little Star on the Lilypad Arduino using the Buzzer. I adapted the original melody code from baojie's "arduino_music.c" (https://gist.github.com/baojie/4522173) to work on the Lilypad.

One tip I would give to my past self would be to pay attention to the void loop and void setup as there were multiple in the original code (with very similar looking/parts that almost looked like they were repeated) and I had tak a lot of time to figure out what each part was actually doing so that I could move things around/rearrange them to consolidate everything into one void setup and one void loop.

## This is was my Lilypad Setup:
