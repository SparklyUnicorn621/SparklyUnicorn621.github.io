In this project, the goal was to show a new random color when the button is pressed, and hold that color until the button is pressed again which it then changes colors when the button is pressed.

One tip I would give my past self is to give myself more time to try and figure out how to do the assignment and understand all the parts. I had thoroughly gone through the tutorialspoint.com website to try and figure out how to do the extra credit and figured out about arrays and tried to implement that here instead of creating 12 if-else statements. I had also come across declaring int as constants (const int) and also tried to implement that here because it seemed kind of important with the use of arrays in the tutorialspoint website but got a little confused as to why they would be necessary because the program runs regardless of me using the const int vs int.
