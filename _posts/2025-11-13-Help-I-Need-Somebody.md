In this project, the goal was to create program that Plays morse code for my name “LAELA” when the alligator clip circuit is open and SOS when the circuit is closed using a buzzer and aligator clips.

One tip I would give my past self is to use the '+' pin instead of the '-' pin with the A9 pin to create my aligator clip circuit because I was having a lot of trouble with the '-' pin with the buzzerpin playing SOS once before permanently switching to just playing my name. I ended up going through a lot of trial and error before connecting my other alligator clip '+' instead of '-' and then it ran correctly.

## This is my setup:
