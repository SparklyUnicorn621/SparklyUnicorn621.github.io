This block of code creates a heart using spaces, backslashes, forwardslashes, underscores, and the letter 'v'. To write this code, I refrenced learn.microsoft.com (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/string-and-character-literals-cpp?view=msvc-170) to figure out how to get backslashes to print without giving me an error code and the lecture slides for how to write most of my code. 

My process for creating this was to first type out a rough draft in notes and then copy that line by line into multiple consecutive print functions. I then went to the internet to figure out how to print a backslash without getting an error code. After figuring that out, I messed around with the spaces a little bit until I was happy with the final result.

Code snipet from the assingment: 
```c  // extra credit question:
    printf("Extra Credit: \n");
    printf("  _       _\n");
    printf("(    \\ /    )\n");
    printf(" \\    v    /\n");
    printf("  \\       /\n");
    printf("    \\   /\n");
    printf("      v\n"); ```
