In this project, the goal was to create program that randomly turns on or off PWM LEDs using arrays. Every second, it randomly selects one PWM pin from the list and either turns it on to a random brightness or turns it off if already on.

One tip I would give my past self is to not get over confident and to make sure to write the code piece by piece and test it as I go instead of writing everything all at once so that it is easier to debug as I go instead of having to go back and try to figure out where I had gone wrong.
