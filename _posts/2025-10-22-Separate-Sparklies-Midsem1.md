In this project, the goal was to mimic the flash patterns of three separate fireflies using a state based approach. The first firefly was a Flash Bulb, whose pattern is to flash for .5 seconds every 4 seconds. The second, a Big Dipper Firefly, whose pattern is to glow at increasing brightnesses over a 3 second cycle. The last, a Synchronous Firefly, whose pattern is to flash 3 times very quickly every 10 seconds.

One tip I would give my past self is to just write my arduino code/make my files in the "sketchbook" rather than "cloud sketch" because I was really struggling to figure out how to upload my code files to Glow from the "cloud sketch" and eventually ended up copying and pasting my code into the "sketchbook" which saves the files locally to my laptop so I could then upload them to glow.
