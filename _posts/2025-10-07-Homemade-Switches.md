In this project, the goal was to create two different switches. The first switch I made was using satin stiches with conductive thread and felt in the shape of a butterfly. The second switch I made was using one square of conductive fabric cut into two pieces and felt in the shape of a heart. Each button controlled their own light and connected to the same battery holder.

One tip I would give my past self is to test with alligator clips as I go to make sure that I don't sew in a light backwards and then have to cut it out and redo it.
