In this project, the goal was to This program combines the code from the Flash Bulb, Big Dipper, and Synchonous firefly programs into one file. It also includes code to mimic the light pattern of the Blue Ghost firefly (XC small) that glows continuously and increases or deacreases brightness every 0.5s.

One tip I would give my past self is to give myself more time to try and figure out how to do the assignment and understand all the parts. I had thoroughly gone through the tutorialspoint.com website to try and figure out how to do all three parts of the extra credit but only ended up figureing out the Blue Ghost one.
